## Introduction

This repository is designed to complement the articles published on my Medium blog. Each month, a new data science concept will be explored in a Medium article, and a corresponding Jupyter notebook will be published here to demonstrate practical applications of the discussed concepts.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:


- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for each month.
- **datasets/**: Contains any datasets used in the notebooks.
- **scripts/**: Contains any additional scripts or helper functions.
