# Enhancing Medical Predictions: A Comprehensive Guide to Model Calibration

## Introduction

Welcome to the project repository for "Enhancing Medical Predictions: A Comprehensive Guide to Model Calibration". This repository accompanies a Medium article that delves into the importance of model calibration in medical predictions and provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to implementing these techniques using Python. The primary focus of this script is to illustrate the concept of calibration rather than optimize the model's performance.

## Purpose of the Script

The main goal of this script is to demonstrate how to assess and enhance the calibration of a predictive model. Using a publicly available Chest X-ray dataset from Kaggle, the script walks through the process of training a neural network model, evaluating its calibration, and applying calibration techniques such as Platt Scaling. The emphasis is on understanding and improving model calibration to ensure reliable and accurate predictions in medical applications.

## Detailed Description of the Script

### Class: `ChestXRayClassifier`

This class encapsulates the entire workflow for training, evaluating, and calibrating a model to classify chest X-ray images. Below is a detailed breakdown of its components:


### Loading Data

function: `load_data`Purpose: Loads the training, validation, and test datasets.
Data Augmentation: Applies various augmentations to the training data to improve model robustness.
Parameters:
`train_dir`: Directory containing training images.
`val_dir`: Directory containing validation images.
`test_dir`: Directory containing test images.

### Building the Model
function:`build_model`Purpose: Builds a neural network model using MobileNetV2 with custom layers on top.
Parameters:
fine_tune_ratio: Ratio of layers to fine-tune during training.
learning_rate: Learning rate for the optimizer.

### Training the Model
`train_model`
Purpose: Trains the model on the training dataset with early stopping.
Parameters:
epochs: Number of epochs to train the model.
early_stopping_patience: Patience parameter for early stopping.

### Generating Pr√©dictions
function: `generate_predictions`
Purpose: Generates predictions on the validation or test dataset.
Parameters:
subset: Specifies whether to generate predictions on the validation or test set.

### Evaluating Model Performance
Function: `evaluate_stats`
Purpose: Evaluates the model using various metrics such as AUC, balanced accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Brier score, and ECE.
Parameters:
preds: Predicted probabilities.
y_true: True labels.

### Enhancing Calibration
Function: `enhance_calibration`
Purpose: Enhances model calibration using Platt Scaling on the validation set.

### Applying Platt Scaling
Function: `apply_platt_scaling`
Purpose: Applies Platt Scaling to the predictions and evaluates the enhanced model.
Parameters:
platt_model: Trained Platt Scaling model.
subset: Specifies whether to apply Platt Scaling on the validation or test set.

### Saving the Model
Purpose: Saves the trained model to the specified path.
Parameters:
model_path: Path to save the model.

### How to Use
1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
2. Install Dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Script:
```python
from data_explorer import DataExplorer
from chest_xray_classifier import ChestXRayClassifier

# Directories
train_dir = "chest_xray/train"
val_dir = "chest_xray/val"
test_dir = "chest_xray/test"

# Data exploration
explorer = DataExplorer(train_dir, val_dir, test_dir)
image_stats = explorer.get_image_statistics()
print("Image Statistics:", image_stats)
patient_stats = explorer.get_patient_statistics()
print("Patient Statistics:", patient_stats)
explorer.display_sample_images(num_images=5)

# Initialize and use the classifier
classifier = ChestXRayClassifier()
classifier.load_data(train_dir, val_dir, test_dir)
classifier.build_model()
classifier.train_model()
preds, y_true = classifier.generate_predictions()
classifier.evaluate_stats(preds, y_true)
platt_model = classifier.enhance_calibration()
classifier.apply_platt_scaling(platt_model)
classifier.save_model("chest_xray_model.h5")
```
