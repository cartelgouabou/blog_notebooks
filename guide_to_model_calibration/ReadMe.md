# Enhancing Medical Predictions: A Comprehensive Guide to Model Calibration

## Introduction

Welcome to the project repository for "Enhancing Medical Predictions: A Comprehensive Guide to Model Calibration". This repository accompanies a Medium article that delves into the importance of model calibration in medical predictions and provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to implementing these techniques using Python. The primary focus of this script is to illustrate the concept of calibration rather than optimize the model's performance.

## Purpose of the Script

The main goal of this script is to demonstrate how to assess and enhance the calibration of a predictive model. Using a publicly available Chest X-ray dataset from Kaggle, the script walks through the process of training a neural network model, evaluating its calibration, and applying calibration techniques such as Platt Scaling. The emphasis is on understanding and improving model calibration to ensure reliable and accurate predictions in medical applications.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project environment and run the scripts:

## Code Structure
The project consists of several key components, each serving a specific function in the process of model training and evaluation:

DataExplorer: Handles the exploration and visualization of dataset statistics.
ChestXRayClassifier: Manages data loading, model building, training, and calibration processes.
### Key Functions

`load_data()`: Loads the datasets for training, validation, and testing.
`build_model()`: Constructs the neural network using MobileNetV2 architecture.
`train_model()`: Trains the model and applies early stopping.
`generate_predictions()`: Generates predictions on the dataset.
`evaluate_stats()`: Evaluates the model using various statistical metrics.
`enhance_calibration()`: Applies calibration techniques to improve model reliability.
`apply_platt_scaling()`: Applies Platt Scaling to the model predictions.
`save_model()`: Saves the trained model for future use.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a practical guide to understanding and implementing model calibration in the context of medical predictions using deep learning. By following the steps outlined in this repository, users can gain insights into the calibration process and apply these techniques to their own predictive models.
